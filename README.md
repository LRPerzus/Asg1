“Gilmore shop”

Intended Audience : People who want to buy magic and fantastical items from a mystic and shimmering Host

Purpose of website to list items a dnd party can buy instead of just an excel document.

Design Process:
Looking at other shopping website I took note of theit design like haveing a navigation bar above and the items listed in a box afterwards

I also wanted to have an system that when i need a new item to sell all i need is to enter the items details into the class and will create a new item in the html for me.

I personally made all the icons that are not listed in the Credits

Function:
1)Creation of Classes in the future when reading from a doc will auto create the element and place them into the html without me needing to do it manually.
2)Form Users can enter the type of object they want and what it does which give me the info needed to create it 

Technologies Used:
-Html
-Java
-JavaScript
-Css
